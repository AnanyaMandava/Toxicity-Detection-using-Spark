# Toxicity-Detection-using-Spark
Detection of Toxicity in the comments using Apache spark and machine learning models

This project aims to develop a scalable and efficient system for detecting toxic comments in online platforms using Apache Spark and various machine learning techniques. Utilizing a dataset comprising online comments with various toxicity labels, the project involves processing and analyzing large volumes of textual data, implementing feature engineering, and applying both machine learning and deep learning models. The objective is to identify and categorize comments based on their toxicity level, enhancing the online user experience by moderating harmful content.
